# Dante's build of dmenu

- Forked from the [Official suckless dmenu repo](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)


## Installation

You must have `libxft-bgra` installed for emoji support otherwise emojis won't work and your dmenu might crash.

After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make clean install` it.
